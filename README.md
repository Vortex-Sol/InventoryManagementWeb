### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
Clone the repository to your local machine in your desired path (traverse to it using cd in terminal):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vortex-Sol/InventoryManagementWeb.git
    cd InventoryManagementWeb   
    ```

2. **Create a New Branch**
Create a new branch to isolate your changes & features. Use a descriptive branch name:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature.name-category
    ```

Where:
   - Feature is the code you are working on
   - Category is the status of the feature; **use**: 
     - _fix_ [You are fixing a bug]
     - _patch_ [You forgot to add something] 
     - _update_ [You are creating a new feature] 
     - _temp_ [You are temporarily introducing a feature -> to be removed later]
     
Example branch name:
```
git checkout -b report.system-update
```
    
> **Tip:** Avoid making changes on the main branch explicitly

### Submitting Changes
1. **Make Your Changes**
   - Make your edits or additions to the codebase
   - Ensure your code is **formatted properly** and follows standard style guides
   - **Write test**, if applicable, for any new functionality
   - Verify everything works correctly before commiting

2. **Fetch Newest  Main**
    - Make sure you are on the newest main
    - Do ```git fetch origin main```
    - To resolve any merge conflicts >> contact the team
   
3. **Commit Your Changes**
