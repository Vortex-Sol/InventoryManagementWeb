# ðŸ“¦ Inventory Management Web App â€“ Vortex Solution

A web-based inventory management system built to streamline warehouse operations and sales tracking. This project serves as a proof-of-concept (POC) with plans for future integration of barcode scanning and POS systems.

---

## Project Goals & Vision

### Version 1: Proof of Concept (Current)
- Add, remove, or sell items from inventory via web interface.

### Version 2: Barcode Integration
- Automatically generate unique SKU for new items.
- Print barcodes for tagging products.

### Version 3: Barcode Scanning
- Use USB barcode scanner to retrieve item info.
- Update inventory and finance tables upon sales or removal.

### Version 4: Enterprise POS Integration *(Future Goal)*
- Integrate with POS systems to process payments.
- Automatically reduce inventory and record sales upon payment success.

## Prerequisites

- **Java** 17 or higher
- **Gradle** (Wrapper included)
- **MySQL** (Database setup required >> FUTURE)

## Contributing
To contribute, please follow the steps below to ensure a smooth and successful submission

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
Clone the repository to your local machine in your desired path (traverse to it using cd in terminal):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vortex-Sol/InventoryManagementWeb.git
    cd InventoryManagementWeb   
    ```

2. **Create a New Branch**
Create a new branch to isolate your changes & features. Use a descriptive branch name:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature.name-category
    ```

Where:
   - Feature is the code you are working on
   - Category is the status of the feature; **use**: 
     - _fix_ [You are fixing a bug]
     - _patch_ [You forgot to add something] 
     - _update_ [You are creating a new feature] 
     - _temp_ [You are temporarily introducing a feature -> to be removed later]
     
Example branch name:
```
git checkout -b report.system-update
```
    
> **Tip:** Avoid making changes on the main branch explicitly

### Submitting Changes
1. **Make Your Changes**
   - Make your edits or additions to the codebase
   - Ensure your code is **formatted properly** and follows standard style guides
   - **Write test**, if applicable, for any new functionality
   - Verify everything works correctly before commiting

2. **Fetch Newest  Main**
    - Make sure you are on the newest main
    - Do ```git fetch origin main```
    - To resolve any merge conflicts >> contact the team
   
3. **Commit Your Changes**
Use clear, descriptive commit messages
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Update: implemented Report System" -m "I created the appropriate Mappers, DTOs and Models. We are missing a service class"
    ```
4. **Push to Your Fork**
Push changes to your forked repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin report.system-update
    ```

5. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**
- Go to the original repository on GitHub
- Click "Compare & Pull Request" next to your recently pushed branch
- Title should be relevant feature issue
  - for e.g., **[3B] Report System**
- Provide a detailed description of your changes and what they do
  - for e.g., _The report system creates reports based on period or time for employees, receipts, inventory or all. A report includes...._ 
- Submit the pull request for review
  - assign 2 team members as reviewers to review your changes
  - assign yourself as an assignee
  - assign a label to the pull request

6. **Respond to Review Feedback**
- Be responsive to any comments, questions or change requests from the team members
- Push follow-up commits to the same branch; the PR will update automatically
- Finally merge to main once everyone approve

## Systems

### Audit System

### Notification System (Future)

### Report System
We can a few report types:
- salesman
- inventory
- receipts
- general (all 3)

Report can be either generated based on period, e.g. from 15th to 20th FEB, or based on Today.
For employees, it should provide employee login audits, (and logouts but we didn't implement a registree for logouts, frontend wise we will leave that to konrad), sales an employee was responsible for.
Sales should present data of totals profits based on period and product. It should also contain information on refunds (we dont have refund entity yet, igmore this) and canceled/failed transactions.
Inventory should present data about new stock/quantity of products that came, and current stock.

### Receipt System

### Setting System
The setting system should enable to toggle on/off or set the following settings:

1. Alert When a Stock is Low (True / False) >> if true the notification system (we need to build a notification system but this is for the future) sends email
2. Auto Generate a Report: (True / False)
3. Set Auto Generate a Report Time (if 2. is set to True)
4. Set Minimum cash discrepancy (the minimum amount of money that does not add up: expected money in cash register vs actual amount)
5. Set the number of days a refund is possible
6. At what time counting cash must start
7. At what time does counting cash (at the end of day) must start
8. At what time should the system generate an inventory report

## Future Features
- Dashboard with KPIs and charts
- Barcode printing and scanning
- POS integration
- Google Sheets export
- Enhanced role permissions
